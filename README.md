Hallo! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm **Miguel**, and this is an **open-source ROS 2 project** for the low-cost arm robot **SO101**.  
Itâ€™s still under development, but I believe itâ€™s time to share it with the community ðŸ’ª  

---

## Overview

This repository provides the **ROS 2 workspace** for controlling and simulating the SO101 arm.  
It includes:
- URDF/Xacro models for visualization
- Basic kinematics and control nodes (C++/Python)
- Launch files for bringing up the robot and testing movement
- Example configurations for MoveIt and Gazebo (coming soon)

The mechanical frame is based on the work of [AntoBrandi](https://github.com/AntoBrandi), whose open-source designs inspired me to learn by building.
